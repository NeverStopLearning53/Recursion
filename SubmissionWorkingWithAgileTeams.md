## **1. What are the typical Agile team roles and what parts of the development lifecycle is each role responsible for?**
* **Product Manager** is sometimes known as a **Product Owner**, but these roles may also be distinct. The **PM** is responsible for the strtegy, roadmap, and feature definition of a product or product line.
* **Project Manager**(**APM**) is responsible for the process management and on-time delivery of one or more product teams.
* A **Designer** is responsible for the look and feel of a product. They create the product mock-ups, wireframes, and interactions for the product.
* A **User Researcher** is responsible for understanding the reasons behind the behavior, wants, needs, and priorities of your users. They usually run tests and create **personas**, a profile of a specific type of target user.
* A **Team Lead** is responsible for the technical management, direction, and quality of one or more projects. A **Team Lead** may serve as an **individual contributor** and/or a manager.
* A **Developer** is responsible for technical creation, maintenance, and overall integrity of the product.

## **2. Why do we use Kanban boards in Agile development?**
Agile teams rely on a **Kanban board** to stay organized.  **Kanban boards** visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each state of the process. Cards are moved from the left to right to show progress and to help coordinate teams performing the work. A **Kanban board** may be divided into horizontal "swimlanes" representing different kinds of work or different teams performing the work.  A popular example of a **Kanban board** for **agile** or lean software deveopment consists of Backlog, Ready, Coding, Testing, Aproval, and Done columns. 

Explain velocity and sprint as if you were teaching another student.
First the definitions of each are as follows:

Velocity - How many points a team accomplishes per sprint on average

Sprint - A time-delineated work cycle for a product team. Usually two weeks.

I would explain that Velocity has to do with how much work this team accomplishes in a time-delineated work cycle. How much "on average" does this team accomplish in a Sprint/work cycle.

A Sprint is that time-delineated work cycle usually two weeks in length.

## **3. What format makes a good user story?**

As a ______(choices are "user", "product owner", or "developer"), I want _____(things like "I want to see all my previous orders, so I can order the products I use frequently and not have to remember each order" or "I want to be able to track the appearance of my specials in front of the customer so that I can make improvements to the website so customers order more weekly specials.") so ___".
## **What are different estimation methods teams can use? Explain pros and cons of each method. Which method would you prefer?**

Each team member must keep in mind that we are not assigning a specific amount of time to each card but comparing the complexity and size of work to the other cards.

The real benefit to using cards versus group discussion is that group discussion individuals can influence the decisions of other members of the team ... it is important to take titles and others opinions out of the estimating process. After the initial estimation takes place then a group discussion can happen as to the why a certain value or amount of work was chosen for a card so that the whole team can agree on a estimation for a card. 

Estimation is not intended to be a "cast in stone" process as things may come up after the fact indicating that this specific cards value will need to be adjusted up or down ... that is not a bad thing and instead a learning experience for future estimate sessions.

One estimation method is through the use of "cards"*. I am not refering to playing cards but cards which have a sequence of numbers like:

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34 (Fibonacci Sequence)
0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 (Factors of 2)

Another method is T-Shirt Sizes
XS, S, M, L, XL - Drawback here is if there is a wide range of time estimates in the cards you are looking at you are limited to only 5 choices so maybe a Fibonacci Sequence or Factors of 2 would be a better choice.


By *"cards" I am refering to 

## **4. Give a real-world example of a development project, and explain the breakdown into epic(s), slices, cards, and tasks.**

Epic(s) The project - Add a new registration page.

slices A section of an Epic organized by feature or part of the stack. Usually contains multiple cards. - page front, page behind, client-side scripting, , and api. Another way to slice up the projects is registration form, create new user, on registration fail, and on registration success.

cards The smallest complete unit of work. Example "create a new user"

task A piece of work needed to create a feature. There may be one task for a card or there may be many depending upon the contents of the card.
Breaks down the card ... example ... create a new user, make it reponsive, add a test.



## **5. Explain in your own words what a dual-track system is and what advantages it provides.**

The current trend in Agile development is to utilize a dual-track systerm. In thi system, teams work on research and product design **(Discovery)** concurrently(at the same time) as the development**(Delivery)** of a proven product. This system allows for faster delivery of a software product and prevents either group from having dead time while waiting for the other to complete their work.


## **6. Choose one of the following projects and write each card that would be in the epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?##**

Planning a Vacation

Card 1 - Identify Who is going on vacation (entire family or only certain family members)? - Research Stage 1

Card 2 - How much time is available for vacation? Can the kids get out of school ... can husband get off from work ... - Research Stage 1

Card 3 - How much $$$ is available for vacation this year ... Research Stage Estimate 1

Card 4 - Decide on a Destination: Get family members input about possible destinations solicit top 4 list from each. Have a family meeting to discuss options. Husband and wife will make a decision and move to card 5. Decision Stage. Estimate 2

Card 5 - Budget Approval ... Yes or No
Will a vacation to destination chosen fit within amount of money available ... If not may have to adjust vacation length to smaller length of time or go back to Card 4 and choose a different destination less expensive. Then go to Card 6. Decision State. Estimate 1

Reserve Airline Tickets first then if successful reserve hotel rooms.
Purchase tickets for events (in this case tickets for Walt Disney World) Preparation Stage Estimate 2

2 weeks before - Notify paper to stop while away
2 weeks before - Have mail stopped while away
Preparation Stage ... Estimate 4

Card 12 - Morning of Trip Verify Uber coming / Get everyone ready / have luggage ready long before Uber arrives. Preparation Stage ... Estimate 1

Columns - Planning Stage; Preparation Stage; 

Project
Create a Trello board for a Hacker News clone.
Create user stories for each feature.
Break the work into slices and epics as needed.
Estimate your cards.
Explain what estimation methods you used.

I really didn't understand this project and maybe this is just way over my head ... after spending over 10 hours on this checkpoint I found myself just wanting to quit this checkpoint and move onto something else. My brain is just shutting down on this material. I created a Trello board for a Hacker News Clone and created user stories for each feature. But after that I just give up ...
